# bearer-auth
auth-server is able to allow a user to create an account as well as to handle Basic Authentication (user provides a username + password). When a “good” login happens, the user is considered to be “authenticated” and our auth-server generates a JWT signed “Token” which is returned to the application  We will now be using that Token to re-authenticate users to shield access to any route that requires a valid login to access.
